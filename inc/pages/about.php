            <p>
                I am from Hungary, I have 2 sons(Alex and Oliver) a dog and cats. I came here in 2012. When I arrived I was going to East Coast College (at the time known as Great Yarmouth College). I've studied on "ESOL" functional skills class for 3 years.
                After leaving college I have worked various jobs. And soon as I got my license I stuck into FastFood delivery driving.

                About 4 years ago after my son became 1 years old, I have decided to start learning Web Development in my freetime. I got as far as HTML, CSS and PHP when things got a hard for us and I had to leave learning and do a second job.
                This year(2023) in January I have gone to JobCenter where they offered me a course through Netmatters. In May, I successfully started the course. Since than, I worked hard and completed multiple assessments. 
                I have worked in team with my Scions and gained skills in explaining my code and understanding others.

                I'm very happy with the goals I achieved and also very keen on learning more, now I'm ready to get a job or help anyone who is in need of a Junior Full Stack Developer.
