                <p>
                    I had to create a JavaScript project (use jQuery and/or other frameworks if you wish) which loads an image from either <a href="https://unsplash.com/documentation">https://unsplash.com/documentation</a> or <a href="https://picsum.photos/">https://picsum.photos</a> and displays on a web page.
                    The JavaScript should be in a separate file from the HTML and the solution should run entirely in the browser without the need to be hosted on a web server.

                    This project is original. The image can be assigned to an email address. On submission, the image is linked to the email address.
                    A new image will display when you click "generate new image", which can be linked to another email address, or the same email address.
                    The interface is displaying all images assigned to each email address and the email address only displays once. Each email address have it's own delete button incase of making a mistake, also pictures can be deleted by clicking them.
