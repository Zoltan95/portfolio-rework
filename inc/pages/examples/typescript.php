                    On my journey at "NetMatters", my first JavaScript task was to add a
                    script to my page which writes out my name on the front page when a "Visitor" enters.

                    After some research through google, I have found multiple examples and tried them out.
                    As they didn't fit with my project I have created my own and took anything thats good from the other versions.
